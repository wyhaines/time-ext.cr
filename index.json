returns the current time in UTC\nTime.local Time::Location.load(\"Europe/Berlin\") # returns the current time in time zone Europe/Berlin\nTime.local                                      # returns the current time in current time zone\n```\n\nIt is generally recommended to keep instances in UTC and only apply a\nlocal time zone when formatting for user display, unless the domain logic\nrequires having a specific time zone (for example for calendaric operations).\n\n### Creating a Specific Instant\n\n`Time` instances representing a specific instant can be created by\n`.utc` or `.new` with the date-time specified as individual arguments:\n\n```\ntime = Time.utc(2016, 2, 15, 10, 20, 30)\ntime.to_s # => 2016-02-15 10:20:30 UTC\ntime = Time.local(2016, 2, 15, 10, 20, 30, location: Time::Location.load(\"Europe/Berlin\"))\ntime.to_s # => 2016-02-15 10:20:30 +01:00 Europe/Berlin\n# The time-of-day can be omitted and defaults to midnight (start of day):\ntime = Time.utc(2016, 2, 15)\ntime.to_s # => 2016-02-15 00:00:00 UTC\n```\n\n### Retrieving Time Information\n\nEach `Time` instance allows querying calendar data:\n\n```\ntime = Time.utc(2016, 2, 15, 10, 20, 30)\ntime.year        # => 2016\ntime.month       # => 2\ntime.day         # => 15\ntime.hour        # => 10\ntime.minute      # => 20\ntime.second      # => 30\ntime.millisecond # => 0\ntime.nanosecond  # => 0\ntime.day_of_week # => Time::DayOfWeek::Monday\ntime.day_of_year # => 46\ntime.monday?     # => true\ntime.time_of_day # => 10:20:30\n```\n\nFor querying if a time is at a specific day of week, `Time` offers named\npredicate methods, delegating to `#day_of_week`:\n\n```\ntime.monday? # => true\n# ...\ntime.sunday? # => false\n```\n\n### Time Zones\n\nEach time is attached to a specific time zone, represented by a `Location`\n(see `#location`).\n`#zone` returns the time zone observed in this location at the current time\n(i.e. the instant represented by this `Time`).\n`#offset` returns the offset of the current zone in seconds.\n\n```\ntime = Time.local(2018, 3, 8, 22, 5, 13, location: Time::Location.load(\"Europe/Berlin\"))\ntime          # => 2018-03-08 22:05:13 +01:00 Europe/Berlin\ntime.location # => #<Time::Location Europe/Berlin>\ntime.zone     # => #<Time::Location::Zone CET +01:00 (3600s) STD>\ntime.offset   # => 3600\n```\n\nUsing `.utc`, the location is `Time::Location::UTC`:\n\n```\ntime = Time.utc(2018, 3, 8, 22, 5, 13)\ntime          # => 2018-03-08 22:05:13.0 UTC\ntime.location # => #<Time::Location UTC>\ntime.zone     # => #<Time::Location::Zone UTC +00:00 (0s) STD>\ntime.offset   # => 0\n```\n\nA `Time` instance can be transformed to a different time zone while retaining\nthe same instant using `#in`:\n\n```\ntime_de = Time.local(2018, 3, 8, 22, 5, 13, location: Time::Location.load(\"Europe/Berlin\"))\ntime_ar = time_de.in Time::Location.load(\"America/Buenos_Aires\")\ntime_de # => 2018-03-08 22:05:13 +01:00 Europe/Berlin\ntime_ar # => 2018-03-08 18:05:13 -03:00 America/Buenos_Aires\n```\n\nBoth `Time` instances show a different local date-time, but they represent\nthe same date-time in the instant time-line, therefore they are considered\nequal:\n\n```\ntime_de.to_utc     # => 2018-03-08 21:05:13 UTC\ntime_ar.to_utc     # => 2018-03-08 21:05:13 UTC\ntime_de == time_ar # => true\n```\n\nThere are also two special methods for converting to UTC and local time zone:\n\n```\ntime.to_utc   # equals time.in(Location::UTC)\ntime.to_local # equals time.in(Location.local)\n```\n\n`#to_local_in` allows changing the time zone while keeping\nthe same local date-time (wall clock) which results in a different instant\non the time line.\n\n### Formatting and Parsing Time\n\nTo make date-time instances exchangeable between different computer systems\nor readable to humans, they are usually converted to and from a string\nrepresentation.\n\nThe method `#to_s` formats the date-time according to a specified pattern.\n\n```\ntime = Time.utc(2015, 10, 12, 10, 30, 0)\ntime.to_s(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %:z\") # => \"2015-10-12 10:30:00 +00:00\"\n```\n\nSimilarly, `Time.parse` and `Time.parse!` are used to construct a `Time` instance from date-time\ninformation in a string, according to a specified pattern:\n\n```\nTime.parse(\"2015-10-12 10:30:00 +00:00\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\", Time::Location::UTC)\nTime.parse!(\"2015-10-12 10:30:00 +00:00\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\")\n```\n\nSee `Time::Format` for all directives.\n\n### Calculations\n\n```\nTime.utc(2015, 10, 10) - 5.days # => 2015-10-05 00:00:00 +00:00\n\nspan = Time.utc(2015, 10, 10) - Time.utc(2015, 9, 10)\nspan.days          # => 30\nspan.total_hours   # => 720\nspan.total_minutes # => 43200\n```\n\n## Measuring Time\n\nThe typical time representation provided by the operating system is based on\na \"wall clock\" which is subject to changes for clock synchronization.\nThis can result in discontinuous jumps in the time-line making it not\nsuitable for accurately measuring elapsed time.\n\nInstances of `Time` are focused on telling time â€“ using a \"wall clock\".\nWhen `Time.local` is called multiple times, the difference between the\nreturned instances is not guaranteed to equal to the time elapsed between\nmaking the calls; even the order of the returned `Time` instances might\nnot reflect invocation order.\n\n```\nt1 = Time.utc\n# operation that takes 1 minute\nt2 = Time.utc\nt2 - t1 # => ?\n```\n\nThe resulting `Time::Span` could be anything, even negative, if the\ncomputer's wall clock has changed between both calls.\n\nAs an alternative, the operating system also provides a monotonic clock.\nIts time-line has no specified starting point but is strictly linearly\nincreasing.\n\nThis monotonic clock should always be used for measuring elapsed time.\n\nA reading from this clock can be taken using `.monotonic`:\n\n```\nt1 = Time.monotonic\n# operation that takes 1 minute\nt2 = Time.monotonic\nt2 - t1 # => 1.minute (approximately)\n```\n\nThe execution time of a block can be measured using `.measure`:\n\n```\nelapsed_time = Time.measure do\n  # operation that takes 20 milliseconds\nend\nelapsed_time # => 20.milliseconds (approximately)\n```","summary":"<p><code><a href=\"Time.html\">Time</a></code> represents a date-time instant in <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/International/articles/definitions-time/#incremental_time\">incremental time</a> observed in a specific time zone.</p>","types":[{"html_id":"time-ext/Time/KHExt","path":"Time/KHExt.html","kind":"module","full_name":"Time::KHExt","name":"KHExt","abstract":false,"locations":[{"filename":"src/time-ext.cr","line_number":1,"url":"https://github.com/wyhaines/time-ext.cr/blob/175f658235fb6cdc9c804cb96da510fec27f4cd6/src/time-ext.cr#L1"}],"repository_name":"time-ext","program":false,"enum":false,"alias":false,"const":false,"constants":[{"id":"VERSION","name":"VERSION","value":"\"1.0.0\""}],"including_types":[{"html_id":"time-ext/Time","kind":"struct","full_name":"Time","name":"Time"}],"namespace":{"html_id":"time-ext/Time","kind":"struct","full_name":"Time","name":"Time"},"instance_methods":[{"html_id":"internal_nanoseconds-instance-method","name":"internal_nanoseconds","doc":"Return the number of nanoseconds in the current second for this Time instance.","summary":"<p>Return the number of nanoseconds in the current second for this Time instance.</p>","abstract":false,"location":{"filename":"src/time-ext.cr","line_number":22,"url":"https://github.com/wyhaines/time-ext.cr/blob/175f658235fb6cdc9c804cb96da510fec27f4cd6/src/time-ext.cr#L22"},"def":{"name":"internal_nanoseconds","visibility":"Public","body":"@nanoseconds"}},{"html_id":"internal_seconds-instance-method","name":"internal_seconds","doc":"Return the number of seconds since the epoch for this Time instance.","summary":"<p>Return the number of seconds since the epoch for this Time instance.</p>","abstract":false,"location":{"filename":"src/time-ext.cr","line_number":16,"url":"https://github.com/wyhaines/time-ext.cr/blob/175f658235fb6cdc9c804cb96da510fec27f4cd6/src/time-ext.cr#L16"},"def":{"name":"internal_seconds","visibility":"Public","body":"@seconds"}},{"html_id":"nanoseconds_since_unix_epoch-instance-method","name":"nanoseconds_since_unix_epoch","doc":"Return the total nanoseconds since the Unix epoch.","summary":"<p>Return the total nanoseconds since the Unix epoch.</p>","abstract":false,"location":{"filename":"src/time-ext.cr","line_number":5,"url":"https://github.com/wyhaines/time-ext.cr/blob/175f658235fb6cdc9c804cb96da510fec27f4cd6/src/time-ext.cr#L5"},"def":{"name":"nanoseconds_since_unix_epoch","visibility":"Public","body":"(self - Time::UNIX_EPOCH).total_nanoseconds.to_u64"}}]}]}]}}
